<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Issues in chewing and swallowing have led to higher rates of malnutrition, poorer immune responses, and higher mortality rates in children<sup>1</sup>.The current clinical standard for measuring chewing ability is the “Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS)”. During this test, clinicians take note of the number of bites, chews, masticatory cycles, and the time to ingest a cracker<sup>2</sup>.  The Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM) sensor system has the potential to provide a completely objective assessment of chewing skills in children.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To develop an algorithm that accurately determines the number of chews from data collected from the AIM sensor set.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first portion of this study had seventeen participants (8 female and 9 male), between the age of 2-10 years old (MEAN=6.47, STD = 2.64). The guardians of each participant and participants were asked to fill out a consent form, share medical history, and give a three-day feeding history.</p>


<p>The AIM sensor system was put on the participants, and participants were instructed to participate in the following activities: </p> 

<ul>
<li>talking </li>
<li>being quiet</li>
<li>taking at least 5 bites of </li>
	<ul>
	<li>a puree (pudding or apple sauce)</li>
	<li>a meltable solid (graham crackers)</li>
	<li>a cubed solid (cubed ham or a fruit cup)</li>
	<li>a soft material (muffins)</li>
	<li>a hard material (fruit leather or a CLIF bar)</li>
	</ul>	
</ul>

<p>The data collected from the jaw were filtered to signals in the bandwidth of 0.5-2.5 Hz applied in MATLAB. This portion of the signal in this range are the frequency at which the jaw moves during chewing. This post-processed signal was then segmented into each type of food eaten (Fig. 2). The videos were manually reviewed to determine the ground truth number of chews in each segment. </p>

<p>After each signal was filtered and segmented, we applied the following algorithms to detect peaks:
Method 1 – Peak Detection by a Static Value (Fig. 3A).
Peak detecting threshold = a certain value – a value was found that minimizes the error of all participants. This is a “One Size Fits All Method.” and the benchmark method.
Peak detecting threshold = a percent a property of the signal – a percent of the property of the signal was found that minimizes the error of all participants.
Method 2 – Delta Peak Detection Method (Fig. 3B)
Peak detecting threshold = a percent of a single property of the signal 
Peak detecting threshold = a linear combination of properties of the signal & participants (Fig.4). 
</p>

<i>Slideshow of Methods</i>

<p>Of the original 17 participants, five participant’s information had to be discarded due to loss of data or the inability to sync the AIM data to the video recording times.</p>

<p>The average unsigned error percentage rate was computed for each method on data provided by the entire group. A two-sample t-test was conducted with, testing for significance from the mean and standard deviation of Method 1A. </p>

<h2>Results & Conclusion</h2>
<p>Method 1B and 2A were found to have the lowest values of minimal error percentages. Many of the variable combinations in Method 2B performed poorer than using Methods 1B and 2A.</p>

<p>The comparison of our best performing method was found to confirm the alternative hypotheses for each portion of a two-sample t-test (puree (p = 0.031), meltable solid (p=0.005), cubed solid (p=0.015), soft material (p=0.004), hard material (p=0.035), overall (p=0.015)). Using our best method, we were able to drive the overall chewing detection error down from 63.9% to 24.5% (Figure 1).  </p>

<h2>Further Direction</h2>
<p>In addition to this peak detection algorithm, a classifier trained on this data set will be able to drive down the error percentages to an acceptable level. In addition, a video classification algorithm that determines bites and chews from a video recording is being refined to detect bites and chews in a pediatric population. </p>
