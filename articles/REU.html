	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p> I spent Summer 2021 working at the <a href="https://reu.eng.ua.edu/programs/engineering-sensors-systems-signal-processing-speech-pathology/">University of Alabama's Research Experience for Undergrads focusing on Engineering Sensors, Systems, and Signal Processing for Speech Pathology.</a> This page serves as a short article about my and summary of some of the specific details of an REU program from a student's perspective. If you have any other questions outside of the ones answered here, please email me and I can update the page appropriately. </p>
	
	<p>For the students reading this, Do you have any interest in the following...</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Attending Graduate School and getting a Masters or Doctorate Degree?</li>
	<li>Participating in Research?</li>
	<li>Wanting to understand how engineering works with other disciplines?</li>
	<li>Attend and present a topic at a conference?</li>
	<li>Looking to get an internship while having most living expenses covered?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you are seriously considering any of these questions, I would urge you to participate in an REU Program. These programs allow undergraduates to spend the summer at a University, working on government-sponsored research projects. They span a wide number of topics and can be the right way to jump into your career. </p>
	
	<h2>Benefits of an REU</h2>
	<p> Attendees of REUs can expect most of the following: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Stipend of about $5,000, with most programs paying for room and board.</li>
	<li>A great experience and point of emphasis on Resumes & Graduate School Applications</li>
	<li>Letters of Recommendation from the Faculty you work with</li>
	<li>Occasionally, sucessful programs can lead to presentations at conferences</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The requirements for these programs are reasonable and most students generally fulfill them</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Minimum GPA of 3.0</li>
	<li>U.S. Citizenship</li>
	<li>Freshman to Junior Level</li>
	<li>Availability to stay on the campus during the program and dedicate 40 hrs./week to the program</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>The REU Experience</h2>
	<p>This section of the article is focused on my particular experience during Summer 2021. I would like to say this experience is typical of all programs, but exceptions apply.</p>
	
	<p>The project I was involved in was "Wearable Sensors for Quantifying Pediatric Chewing and Swallowing." During this project, I worked closely with Dr. Edward Sazonov and his graduate assistant, Delwar Hossain. Our research focused into two efforts. The first was improving the accuracy of detecting chews from the Automatic Ingestion Monitor. The results of this survey can be read about <a href="https://christopherthompsonut.github.io/articles/AIM">here.</a>The second effort on this project was acting as a sort of technician to prepare videos for a pre-trained AlexNet that detects faces and classifies key frames into bites and not bites. More about the original model can be read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7977969/">here.</a> These projects were exciting and engaging, and really sparked my interest into doing graduate studies </p>
	
	<p>This program was focused on involving students in two fields one would not regularly associate with another - engineering and speech therapy. Another great experience this program offered was being able to observe Speech Therapy Sessions and ask speech pathologists direct questions about the patients and procedures observed. This provided what I like to think as a new set of tools to ask intelligent questions about both new and familiar processes.</p>
	
	<p>When we weren't researching, the program provided critcal professional development classes. These discussed topics such as networking, resume and grad-school application crafting, journal publication, poster design and communication skills.We also were able to develop our technical skils by working with MATLAB/Octave and processing recorded signals from the <a href="https://mbientlab.com/store/metamotionrl/"> MetaMotionRL Board </a>, and discuss current research involving the application of sensors.</p>
	
	<p>We also got to experience more "tourist" activities provided by the program. These included trips to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, in Huntsville, AL, and the Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, in Montgomery, AL. While not sponsored by the program, I also experienced trips with friends both inside and outside the program - the included seeing local concerts and events in Tuscaloosa, a visit to the LDS Birmingham Alabama Temple, the Birmingham Botanical Gardens and (my personal favorite) Locked In: The Birmingham Escape Game.</p>
	
	<p>Another great thing about this program was the experience didn't end with the summer. The professors who oversaw this work encouraged a submission to the Biomedical Engineering Society's call for papers. My work was accepted and in Early October, 2021, I was able to fly down to Orlando to present my work, learn about many other wonderful projects, reunite with my great friends from the program, and meet many more wonderful people.</p>
	
	<p>Overall, the program was blast and a formative experience for my career. I hope that my words could convey a tenth of the enthusiasm I have for projects like these. If you are interested, please consider clicking the links below to learn more about the wonderful programs being offered.</p>
