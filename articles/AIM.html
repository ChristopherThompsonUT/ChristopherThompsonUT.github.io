<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Issues in chewing and swallowing have led to higher rates of malnutrition, poorer immune responses, and higher mortality rates in children<sup>1</sup>.The current clinical standard for measuring chewing ability is the “Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS)”. During this test, clinicians take note of the number of bites, chews, masticatory cycles, and the time to ingest a cracker<sup>2</sup>.  The Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM) sensor system has the potential to provide a completely objective assessment of chewing skills in children.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To develop an algorithm that accurately determines the number of chews from data collected from the AIM sensor set.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first portion of this study had seventeen participants (8 female and 9 male), between the age of 2-10 years old (MEAN=6.47, STD = 2.64). The guardians of each participant and participants were asked to fill out a consent form, share medical history, and give a three-day feeding history.</p>


<p>The AIM sensor system was put on the participants (Figure 1), and participants were instructed to participate in the following activities: </p> 

<ul>
<li>talking </li>
<li>being quiet</li>
<li>taking at least 5 bites of </li>
	<ul>
	<li>a puree (pudding or apple sauce)</li>
	<li>a meltable solid (graham crackers)</li>
	<li>a cubed solid (cubed ham or a fruit cup)</li>
	<li>a soft material (muffins)</li>
	<li>a hard material (fruit leather or a CLIF bar)</li >
	</ul>	
</ul>

<p>The data collected from the jaw were filtered to signals in the bandwidth of 0.5-2.5 Hz applied in MATLAB. This portion of the signal in this range are the frequency at which the jaw moves during chewing. This post-processed signal was then segmented into each type of food eaten (Fig. 2). The videos were manually reviewed to determine the ground truth number of chews in each segment. </p>

 <p>This article will go over two methods; a baseline method of detecting chews and the chewing detection method</p>
 <p> Our baseline method to detect chews used a value of strain response (y-value) that minimized the error percentage of each food texture.Chews were detected based on if a peak had a greater magnitude than the value, it was considered a chew. (Fig. 3, <span class="desktop">Left/Top</span>)</p>
 <p>Our chewing detection method used threshold equal to the standardized percentage of the mean absolute value of each chewing signal for each food texture. Chews were detected based on if the distance between a peak and subsequent valley exceeded this threshold. (Fig. 3, <span class="desktop">Right/Bottom</span>)</p>

<h2>Results & Conclusion</h2>
<p>The average error percentage rate was computed for each method and portion of the procedure on data provided by the entire group. The comparison to our chewing detection algorithm was found to confirm the alternative hypotheses for each portion of a two-sample t-test (p < 0.05) ((puree (p = 0.031), meltable solid (p=0.005), cubed solid (p=0.015), soft material (p=0.004), hard material (p=0.035), overall (p=0.015)) (Fig. 4) </p>

The error percentages for the baseline method are 106.0, 55.8, 57.8, 49.5 50.4 and 63.9 for the baseline method detection of Purees, meltable solids, cubed solids, soft materials, hard materials and the overall error. The error percentages for the chewing algorithm are 35.5, 16.9, 25.4 18.1 26.6, 24.5 for Purees, meltable solids, cubed solids, soft materials, hard materials and the overall error." width=50%, height=50% class="center">

<h2>Further Direction</h2>
<p>In addition to this peak detection algorithm, a classifier trained on this data set will be able to drive down the error percentages to an acceptable level. In addition, a video classification algorithm that determines bites and chews from a video recording is being refined to detect bites and chews in a pediatric population. Finally, we hope to use the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32750904/">AIM-v2</a> to detect chews from the Temporalis Muscle. </p>
